*-- Icomoon Information --*

Icomoon is used to compile both custom svg files and font icons in one package.

How To Update:

Go to https://icomoon.io/app/#/select and choose Import Icons button at top of screen.

Within /source/assets/vendor/icomoon, there is a selection.json file, use this and Icomoon will populate with your current set.

Now you can add your own custom svg, or choose from open source (or paid for) icon libraries.

Once added, select all and click the Generate Font button on bottom right side. This will show you your library.

Now you can choose Download button in same area, and it will package up the new icomoon set. This can be dropped into the
/source/assets/vendor/icomoon folder to update.
